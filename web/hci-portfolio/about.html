        <p>I am a student at Brigham Young University - Idaho and I am almost done with my degree! My major is Web
            Design and Development with and emphasis in development. I started out my college career as an Exercise
            Physiology major, but I tried programming one time and fell in love with it. I switched my major and I've
            never regretted it.</p>
