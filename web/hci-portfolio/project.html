        <h1>About my Project</h1>
        <p>My family breeds dogs, and at one point, we had a website for it. But the website wasn't very good so we
            took it down. For my project, I have decided to remake that website so that it is more useful to my family.</p>
        <p>The main focus of the class is the design of the webpage and the functionality for the users. But I am also
            going to focus on making the website functional for my family. They need to be able to update the
            information in there easily, so I will be making a way to do that.</p>
