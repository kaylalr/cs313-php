                    <p>I love playing the piano! I've been playing since I was 8 years 
                        old, and I'm still not tired of it. My favorite things to play are 
                        hymns out of the hymn book and also piano solos of the hymns.</p>
                    <p>For Christmas this year, I got the piano music for Wicked and I'm
                        excited to learn those songs. Wicked has always been a favorite of
                        mine.</p>
                    <p>My first semester here at BYU-Idaho I took a class to learn the 
                        organ. Did you know they had a class for the?! It was a lot of work 
                        because I had to practice an hour a day, but it was a lot of fun! I 
                        can now play hymns on the organ which is a lot of fun.  I'v even 
                        played in Sacrament Meeting, which was very nerve-racking, but it 
                        was good practice!</p>
